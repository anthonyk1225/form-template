## Setup

Clone the repo into your project. This code relies on two packages. [react-native-elements](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-elements) and [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types).

If these aren't in your project's dependencies already, do the following.

```
$ npm i --save react-native-elements
$ npm i --save prop-types
```

Delete the `README` and `example` folder.
